Migrate data from source to sink

**This is a work in progress**

I have been planning to write a tool from sometime to easily convert data between different formats. The basic use cases are 
- File to Database
- File to File
- Database to Database
- Database to File

The database currently supported is postgres.
The currently supported file formats are csv <-> xml.
